                              <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Dhanasrither K , an enthusiastic and tech-driven engineering student pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, graduating in 2026.
    I have a keen interest in software development and am currently focusing on building my skills in Java and web development. I’ve completed a certification in Java from HackerRank and built a personal portfolio website to put my learning into practice.
    My goal is to become a full stack software engineer and work on real-world projects that make a difference. I enjoy solving problems, experimenting with code, watching movies, and hitting the gym. I am actively seeking a fresher role at Cognizant to start my professional journey in the tech industry.</p>
